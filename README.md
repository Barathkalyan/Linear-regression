# Linear-regression
learning machine learning algorithms!
Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line (or plane in multiple dimensions) to the data. It predicts outcomes based on input features.
The provided code implements logistic regression (a classification variant of linear regression) to classify the Iris dataset. It splits the data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates it using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. For visualization, PCA reduces data to 2 dimensions, enabling a plot of decision boundaries. This shows how the model separates classes based on probabilities.
